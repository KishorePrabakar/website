    <p>Sins were probably bed time stories to make people not ending up doing barbarious stuff to each other in the past.
        No problem in that actually. A good way to make people have good virtues and live a moral life. Then comes the manipulative godmen using these concepts
        to promote practices that benefit them (a particular individual or a group).</p>

    <p>As time grows, the original intent (if there was any) disappears and irrational, meaningless practices become deeply rooted to the believers. Any doubt or deviations from the dogma also label you as a sinner. So what's the solution to this?
</p>
    <p>People had monstrous nature initially, Religion, God, Heaven and Hell brought them to place. Science, Technology and Nature revealed more of truth simulataneously. People became less barbaric. All of Earth improved it's objective morals. Killing is bad. Hurting someone physically or mentally is bad. Hurting the self right now or in the future in any way, is bad.</p>
    <p>We don't largely need the concept of sin anymore to be "Good people". We are not sure about the promise of getting into heaven on being a good person or the opposite. That also doesn;t mean you can be well off being a bad guy. Do any crime. You get to jail. Do bad things in jail, people treat you more bad.</p>
    <p>Try indulging yourself in Lust, Greed, Anger, Gluttony, Pride, Envy, Sloth. You shall feel real world punishment in terms of health, wealth, social respect and self respect. No need to wait till death and afterlife for this.</p>
    <p>Get on to some good habits instead. You'll feel purposeful and happy. Even if not, atleast you won't feel pathetic about yourself. Yes, there are people who did greatly evil things and escaped without a bruise till death. They might be the exceptions in this thought process. Sky-daddy didn't care about them either.</p>
