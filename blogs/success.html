    <p> It isn't about luck either. Well, success is a subjective idea. Assuming success to be something achieved after a long period of grit and drive, most are still unclear on achieving it.
        We're not going to fumble with saturated topics like "<b>create daily habits</b>" or "<b>set clear goals</b>", no. We are going to self-interpret ourselves based on the following questions.
    </p><h3>1. What is your social status?</h3>
    <p>Do you get fed 3 times a day without lifting a finger or will you have to actively work for the next meal? Can you be lethargic now but get things sorted later? Ask yourself these questions. My guess is that if you have access to this text, and are actually reading it, you are previlleged af. Think about it. Why would you even work (forget hard work) if you are a previlleged mf.
        Sure, you have all the excuses. You might not have a Porsche in your garage yet, but that doesn't mean you aren't rich. Rich on failure acceptance and backup.
        </p>
        <h3>2. Presence of Mental Pressure</h3>
        <p>
            Emotional trauma (like losing your loved ones), humiliation, restriction to equal oppurtunity, unfair treatment or genuinely high levels of curiosity are common mental patterns you can observe in greatly succesful people. Lighter mindsets include peer pressure driven performance, parental conditioning or even cultural beliefs. Your countless brainrot fed headaches or excessive dopamine hits don't count as fuel for success. They rather drive you away from thy redemption.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Environment</h3>
        <p>
            Peer pressure is underrated. Your friends are lazy douchÄ“bags and so are you. Maybe they have better social status to be like that. Stop coping around, find people in similar situations as yours, gather best resources. Salten up with some ego like the <a href="https://w.wiki/EYKx" style="text-decoration: none; color: orangered;">legend</a> himself.
