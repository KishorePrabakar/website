    <p>
        <u>Standard definition:</u> Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a 
        period of time. It is measured as an annual percentage increase in a basket of goods and services.
        <br><br>
        So what does that mean? Say you and I have <i>$100</i> each. Also, let us assume that we are stranded in an empty island.
        This situation makes us the only citizens to make any financial transactions.
        <br><br>
        Now, we have <i>$100</i> each and that sums up to a total of <i>$200</i> of money available in the island. Adding to the delusion, assume that there are two PS5 consoles in the island. Given that both the consoles are 
        of same value, we can set a price tag of them to be $100 each. </p>

        <p>
        Then comes the fun part. Say multiple PS5s are spawning across the island. What will happen to the price of each PS5 every time a new one appears? Well, if you did the math right, the price of PS5 would go down.
        Meaning, <i><u>the surplus the stock, the lesser the unit value.</u></i> We can see this trend in various places like groceries, consumer goods or even manual services.

        <p>Well, now we understand how the value of products go down, but how do they go up? There can only be 2 ways
            <br><br>
        1. Lack of supply - if one of the two consoles get damaged or lost forever, then the value of the other one becomes $200.
        <br>
        2. Yes, you guessed it right - Inflation.

        <br><br>
        If money spawns out of nowhere (<i>erhmm *the government"</i>) instead of PS5 consoles, then the Money to Stock ratio would change. As there is more money than before, and no big changes to the products, we see the increase in price of the product.
