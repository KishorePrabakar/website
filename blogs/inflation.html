    <p>
        <u>Standard definition:</u> Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a 
        period of time. It is measured as an annual percentage increase in a basket of goods and services.

        So what does that mean? Say you and I have <i>$100</i> each. Also, let us assume that we are stranded in an empty island.
        This situation makes us the only citizens to make any financial transactions.
        <br><br>
        Now, we have <i>$100</i> each and that sums up to a total of <i>$200</i> of money available in the island.
