    <p>
        <u>Standard definition:</u> Inflation is a sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a 
        period of time. It is measured as an annual percentage increase in a basket of goods and services.
        <br><br>
        So what does that mean? Say you and I have <i>$100</i> each. Also, let us assume that we are stranded in an empty island.
        This situation makes us the only citizens to make any financial transactions.
        <br><br>
        Now, we have <i>$100</i> each and that sums up to a total of <i>$200</i> of money available in the island. Adding to the delusion, assume that there are two PS5 consoles in the island. Given that both the consoles are 
        of same value, we can set a price tag of them to be $100 each.
        <br><br>
        Then comes the fun part. Say multiple PS5s are spawning across the island. What will happen to the price of each PS5 every time a new one appears? Well, if you did the math right, the price of PS5 would go down.
        Meaning, <i><u>the surplus the stock, the lesser the unit value.</u></i> We can see this trend in various places like groceries, consumer goods or even manual services.
